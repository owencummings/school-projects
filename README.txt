Here are some files from school projects that I did in the past. These are done in either Java, Python, or C.

Some files are excluded due to potential copyright issues, so the standalone code is non-functional. 
Projects change between years, so this should be fine to publicize.
Projects were done with a partner. Most of the work was done together.





I'll elaborate on the projects here:


- Web Crawler, Python -

Created a web crawler that parses through university class sites and records pertinent data into a database.
The intention is that this database could be used by a student to more easily find suitable classes and create a schedule.



- Genetic Algorithms and the Knapsack Problem, C - 

Uses an iterated genetic algorithms to optimize solutions to a constrained optimization problem. 



- IM Server & Client Codebase, C -


Code for server that creates and manages client-connection threads, and stores data regarding clients in database. 
Code for clients that allows function from server instructions.
Shows good knowledge of IP.




- Additional Material Learned - 

I've taken a class entirely on algorithms and I've got a strong theoretical math background,
so I'm super comfortable with all sorts of algorithm types, O() notation, graph theory, and even basic encryption methods.
